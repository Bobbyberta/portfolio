              The challenge was clear: create a math game that not only taught children about greater than and less than
              but also captivated their imaginations. I wanted to build something more than just flashcards – I wanted
              to create an underwater adventure that would make learning fun.
            </p>

            <p>
              The inspiration struck when I was playing Agar.io, a popular game where players control a growing blob.
              Could this core mechanic – growth and competition – be adapted to teach math? The idea began to take
              shape.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started with paper prototypes, sketching out simple games on paper and testing them with friends. These
              early iterations helped me refine the core mechanic, ensuring it was both engaging and aligned with the
              educational objectives.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, I transitioned to a digital prototype, built using JavaScript. This allowed for more dynamic testing
              and iteration, enabling me to quickly experiment with different gameplay elements and gather feedback from
              colleagues.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the core gameplay established, it was time to bring the underwater world to life. I collaborated
              closely with an artist, exploring various art styles and themes. We ultimately settled on a vibrant and
              colorful underwater environment, teeming with life and inviting exploration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Developing the math curriculum was a collaborative effort with a math specialist. We worked together to
              create a series of challenging yet accessible levels, incorporating adaptive difficulty to ensure the game
              remained engaging for players of all skill levels.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the development process, I conducted rigorous playtesting with children aged 7-11. Observing
              their interactions with the game provided invaluable insights. I watched as they navigated the challenges,
              celebrated their successes, and even offered their own creative suggestions. This feedback was crucial in
              refining the game's difficulty, improving the user interface, and ensuring a truly enjoyable and rewarding
              experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, after months of hard work and dedication, Deepest Ocean was ready to launch. The game was
              well-received, providing a valuable learning resource for children worldwide. It was a rewarding
              experience to see how children interacted with the game and how it helped them develop a deeper
              understanding of mathematical concepts.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design, iterative development, and the power of
              collaboration. It also highlighted the potential of games to make learning engaging and enjoyable for
              children of all ages.
