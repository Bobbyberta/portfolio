                        <p>There's nothing quite like the joy of swapping pixels for paint.</p>
                        <p>I recently stepped away from the screen to tackle an acrylic painting. But as I moved from a blank canvas to the final coat, I realized something funny: I wasn't just making art; I was running a project.</p>
                        <p>My journey from messy blobs to fine details was a perfect mirror of the Lean and Agile methods we use in software every day. Here is how painting offline sharpened my design mindset.</p>

                        <h2>Phase 1: The MVP (Wireframes first)</h2>
                        <p>In dev terms, I had a Product Goal (a reference photo), but I didn't try to copy it line-for-line immediately. That would be a disaster.</p>
                        <p>Instead, I started with the MVP. I slapped down masses of color and big, foundational shapes. I ignored the eyelashes and leaf veins (the "features") and focused purely on the composition (the "wireframe").</p>
                        
                        <div class="img-container">

                        </div>
                        
                        <p>The lesson? Don't polish code that doesn't work yet. Get the broad strokes right before you worry about the UI details.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Phase 2: The Tech Stack (Why I chose Acrylics)</h2>
                        <p>The medium you choose is your tech stack. I picked acrylics because they dry in minutes.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="lined-list">
                            <li><strong>Oils = Waterfall:</strong> Beautiful, but slow. You commit to a path and wait days for it to dry.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acrylics = Agile:</strong> Fast and forgiving.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Because the paint dried so fast, I could "ship" a layer, realize it didn't work, and paint over it (refactor) immediately. It allowed for rapid prototyping and pivot-friendly creativity.</p>

                        <h2>Phase 3: The Digital QA (Sprint Retros)</h2>
                        <p>Even though I was analog, I used a digital cheat code for my Quality Assurance.</p>
                        <p>When I became "code blind" (staring at the canvas too long to see errors), I took a photo of my painting and digitally overlaid it with the source image. It instantly highlighted where my perspective was off.</p>
                        
                        <div class="img-container">

                        <p>This was my Sprint Retrospective. I paused, measured the current build against the desired outcome, found the bugs, and fixed them before the next session.</p>
                        
                        <div class="img-container">

                        <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                        <p>Stepping away from the keyboard was a massive creative recharge. But more importantly, it proved that Agile isn't just a Jira workflow—it's a way of creating.</p>
