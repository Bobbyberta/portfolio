                    <p>
                        When we set out to create Little Raincloud, a maths game aimed at 5–7-year-olds, our goal was 
                        simple: make learning place value engaging and accessible. The game would eventually become a 
                        beloved tool for early learners, but its journey from concept to final release is a story worth sharing.
                    </p>

                        <img src="../../assets/images/little-raincloud-hero.png" 
                             alt="Little Raincloud game interface" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Idea</h2>
                    <p>
                        At Mangahigh, we continuously analyze our platform to identify content gaps. In early 2018, we 
                        noticed a significant void in the area of KS1 Number and Place Value games, critical for young 
                        learners building foundational maths skills. By discussing this with teachers and reviewing 
                        classroom strategies, it became evident that a game addressing this need could provide tremendous value.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We delved deeper, interviewing educators and a Dyscalculia tutor to understand the common 
                        challenges students face when learning place value. This research informed the creative phase, 
                        where we explored different ways to teach the concept.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/little-raincloud-design.png" 
                             alt="Design process documentation" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Concept</h2>
                    <p>
                        Armed with insights, we sketched numerous ideas and prototyped three core concepts:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>City Plan: Players build houses of various sizes by arranging numbers in the correct order.</li>
                        <li>Air Traffic: Planes are landed in the correct spaces to create requested numbers.</li>
                        <li>Plants: Players rearrange bubbles to adjust the water volume in a raincloud and help plants grow.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The team gravitated toward the plant idea, drawn to its visual appeal and playful mechanics. 
                        Thus, Little Raincloud was born.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Building the Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the concept finalized, the real work began. As the design lead, I guided the development 
                        process, creating a comprehensive Games Design Document (GDD) to outline every detail. We broke 
                        the project into three phases, tracked progress using Asana, and collaborated closely with a 
                        cross-disciplinary team of developers, artists, and educators.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/little-raincloud-development.png" 
                             alt="Development process and documentation" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        In Phase 1, we validated the game's core mechanics through prototyping. Phase 2 saw us refine 
                        gameplay and introduce essential features like level configuration. By Phase 3, we polished the 
                        experience with added gamification layers to keep young learners engaged.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Challenges and Testing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Testing was a vital part of the journey. After each development phase, the game underwent 
                        rigorous QA testing to identify bugs and fine-tune mechanics. For instance, video documentation 
                        proved invaluable when screenshots couldn't fully capture gameplay issues.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/little-raincloud-testing.png" 
                             alt="Testing with primary school students" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The real test came when we introduced Little Raincloud to its intended audience. At a local 
                        primary school, 20 children aged 5–7 played the game, providing invaluable feedback on graphics, 
                        difficulty levels, and overall enjoyment. Their enthusiasm affirmed we were on the right track.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since its release, Little Raincloud has become a favorite on the Mangahigh platform, with over 
                        220,000 plays and 75,000 medals earned. Available in three languages and compatible with mobile, 
                        tablet, and desktop, it's reached learners around the globe, turning a challenging concept into 
                        an engaging experience.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
