                    <p>
                        When it comes to online education, accessibility is often the key to transforming an experience 
                        from exclusive to inclusive. At Mangahigh, an innovative math-learning platform for students aged 
                        5 to 17, accessibility had taken a backseat during its initial design. This limited its usability 
                        for students with diverse learning needs and, ultimately, the platform's market potential.
                    </p>

                        <img src="../../assets/images/accessibility-journey-hero.png" 
                             alt="Accessibility features showcase" 
                             class="img-responsive"

                    </div> -->

                    <p>
                        As the Lead Designer working closely with our CEO and a small team of developers, I took on the 
                        challenge of reshaping Mangahigh to become a more inclusive and student-friendly product. What 
                        started as a daunting task turned into a journey of breaking down complex problems, designing 
                        thoughtful solutions, and learning how accessibility benefits everyone.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mangahigh's platform is designed to engage students through games, quizzes, leaderboards, and 
                        personalized dashboards. Its global reach meant it was already translated into multiple languages 
                        and locales. However, the platform's accessibility fell short, excluding students with disabilities 
                        and limiting its usability for educators supporting diverse learning needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We needed to redefine how Mangahigh could meet accessibility standards and reimagine the platform 
                        to support every student. My role involved researching the problem, proposing solutions, and 
                        integrating accessibility principles into our design system.
                    </p>

                             alt="Research findings visualization" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <h2>Laying the Groundwork</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first step was research. I conducted interviews with four education specialists who worked 
                        with students facing a variety of challenges. Their insights highlighted a common theme: 
                        customization. Every classroom is different, and educators need tools that can adapt to the 
                        specific needs of their students.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also analyzed competitors in the EdTech space, focusing on platforms recognized for their 
                        accessibility. Some used built-in solutions, while others relied on third-party tools. Testing 
                        these tools on Mangahigh's platform helped me understand what worked and what didn't. Additionally, 
                        I delved into accessibility guidelines, particularly those from the W3C, to establish a solid 
                        framework for our design decisions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Breaking Down the Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        The scope of the project initially felt overwhelming. To tackle it effectively, I proposed 
                        splitting the work into four focus areas: keyboard navigation, text-to-speech, an accessible 
                        style guide, and a customizable user interface.
                    </p>
<!-- 
                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../images/accessibility-components.png" 
                             alt="Style guide components and accessibility features" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <p>
                        Keyboard navigation ensured that users with motor impairments could navigate the platform without 
                        a mouse. This required rewriting parts of the codebase to improve HTML semantics and designing 
                        clear focus and hover states for buttons.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For students with visual impairments, we integrated text-to-speech functionality. A native screen 
                        reader was combined with a custom solution for reading math notation, ensuring students could 
                        easily understand complex content.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Designing the Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        The accessible style guide was one of the most rewarding aspects of the project. It began with 
                        a thorough audit of Mangahigh's content and platform. Using the design checklist, I identified 
                        areas needing improvement and collaborated with the marketing and design teams to implement changes.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../images/accessibility-testing.png" 
                             alt="Testing sessions with users" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <p>
                        Customizing the user interface was another transformative step. While the React rebuild ensured 
                        responsiveness, I also explored ways to give students more control. Concept sketches included 
                        features for adjusting typography and color schemes, empowering students or their educators to 
                        tailor the experience to their unique needs.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accessibility benefits all users, not just those with specific needs</li>
                        <li>Breaking down large challenges into focused areas makes them manageable</li>
                        <li>Collaboration between design and development is crucial for success</li>
                        <li>User testing with diverse groups provides invaluable insights</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        Making Mangahigh more accessible wasn't just about redesigning a platformâ€”it was about 
                        reimagining how students engage with math education. Through research, thoughtful design, and 
                        collaboration, we've taken meaningful steps toward inclusivity. And while there's still more to 
                        do, this journey proves that when accessibility is prioritized, everyone benefits.
