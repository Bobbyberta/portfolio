                    <p>
                        In the ever-evolving world of educational technology, adaptability is key. As a Lead Designer at 
                        Mangahigh, an online game-based math platform for students aged 5 to 17, I recently spearheaded 
                        an exciting project to integrate with Google for Education. This narrative captures the journey, 
                        challenges, and rewards of creating a user-friendly experience that not only streamlined access 
                        but also positioned Mangahigh as a competitive player in the ed-tech space.
                    </p>

                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">

                    <h2>The Landscape: Opportunity in Adversity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Six months into the global pandemic, education was undergoing a seismic shift. Schools worldwide 
                        were adapting to remote learning, and tech giants like Google and Microsoft seized the moment, 
                        rolling out hardware and content management systems to support educators and students. With schools 
                        racing to get students online, Google quickly added 40 million users to its platform.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Amid this landscape, Mangahigh saw a golden opportunity: by partnering with Google, we could tap 
                        into their massive user base of 150 million while improving our own user experience. Beyond exposure, 
                        such a partnership promised reduced hosting costs and increased visibility through Google's Marketplace. 
                        The challenge? To become a certified Google Partner for Education, we needed to integrate with at least 
                        three of their products or features.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Laying the Groundwork: Research and Strategy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The integration process began with extensive research, where we analyzed competitors and identified 
                        the most impactful ways to collaborate with Google. Key integration options included:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="lined-list">
                        <li>Single Sign-On (SSO): Simplifying login processes for students and teachers.</li>
                        <li>Google Classroom Share Button: Enabling easy sharing of Mangahigh activities.</li>
                        <li>Google Classroom API: Allowing seamless integration of coursework, roster management, and reporting.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Understanding Our Users: Tailored Flows for Different Needs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Three distinct user groups were identified for the integration:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="lined-list">
                        <li>New Users with G Suite for Education accounts.</li>
                        <li>New Users with Gmail accounts.</li>
                        <li>Existing Mangahigh Users.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Each group had unique requirements, necessitating different user flows. Prioritizing development 
                        was guided by business value, ensuring we addressed the needs of high-impact users first.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Designing the Solution: A Seamless Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        The integration brief focused on four core components:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="lined-list">
                        <li>Login: Adding an SSO button for Google users.</li>
                        <li>Setup – Manual: Supporting school administrators with a streamlined import process.</li>
                        <li>Setup – Self-Serve: Empowering users to configure or remove Google integration independently.</li>
                        <li>Assignment Management: Ensuring Mangahigh activities were accurately displayed in Google Classroom.</li>
                    </ul>

                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <h2>Testing and Refining: Usability Studies</h2>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the integration met user needs, we conducted usability studies, testing four critical flows:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="lined-list">
                        <li>Finding the setup button.</li>
                        <li>Completing the setup process.</li>
                        <li>Resending invite links.</li>
                        <li>Logging in via email links.</li>
                        <li>Removing access.</li>
                    </ul>

                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul class="lined-list">
                        <li>Integration success relies on deep understanding of both platforms</li>
                        <li>User research is crucial for identifying and prioritizing features</li>
                        <li>Iterative testing leads to more intuitive user experiences</li>
                        <li>Post-launch marketing is as important as the technical implementation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project underscored the power of thoughtful design in addressing real-world challenges. By 
                        integrating with Google, Mangahigh not only enhanced its user experience but also opened doors to 
                        a vast audience of potential users. The journey exemplified collaboration, adaptability, and a 
                        relentless focus on creating value for both users and the business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For designers, the lesson is clear: when you understand your users and align their needs with 
                        business goals, the results can be transformative.
