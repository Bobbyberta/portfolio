                    <p>
                        In 2019, Mangahigh, a leading online platform for gamified math education, set out to conquer 
                        a new frontier: coding education. The challenge was both exciting and daunting—how could we 
                        empower teachers and students in a subject where even the curriculum itself was still evolving?
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="/assets/coding-education-hero-Bhg6RA_W.png" 
                             alt="Illustration of a young student coding on a tablet" 
                             class="img-responsive"

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        As part of the design team, I had the privilege of helping shape a product that could make 
                        coding accessible, engaging, and impactful for young learners. This is the story of how we 
                        made it happen.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A New Challenge for Teachers</h2>
                    <p>
                        For years, Mangahigh had been a trusted name in math education, known for turning complex 
                        concepts into games that kids loved to play. But coding was a whole new ballgame. Unlike math, 
                        where well-established teaching methods existed, the coding curriculum was uncharted territory.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="/assets/coding-education-challenge-C71YogTT.png" 
                             alt="Teacher in classroom showing coding concepts" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Teachers were often unequipped to teach the subject, let alone guide students from following 
                        instructions to coding independently. This wasn't just a gap; it was a chasm. Our goal was to 
                        build a bridge—not just for students but for the teachers who would be their guides.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Opportunity in the Unknown</h2>
                    <p>
                        The project came with a distinct advantage: Mangahigh's existing platform. With its personalized 
                        dashboards, leaderboards, and gamified learning, we had a proven foundation to build on. The 
                        question was, how do we translate the excitement and structure of math education into a completely 
                        new subject?
                    </p>

                             loading="lazy">

                    <p>
                        Enter our curriculum expert, a veteran who had helped shape the UK's National Curriculum. With 
                        their expertise and Mangahigh's established platform, we had the tools to craft something unique. 
                        All we needed was a clear plan—and a lot of creativity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Laying the Groundwork: Research and Insights</h2>
                    <p>
                        The journey began with research. I dove deep into competitor analysis, exploring what was already 
                        out there. Which interaction designs were effective? How did other platforms make coding 
                        approachable for young learners? What parts of the curriculum did they excel at—and where did 
                        they fall short?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But this wasn't just about competition; it was about pedagogy. Coding can seem abstract and 
                        daunting, so we needed to anchor it in solid, research-backed teaching principles. Working 
                        closely with the curriculum expert, we visualized this research, turning dense educational 
                        theory into digestible, teacher-friendly formats.
                    </p>

                    <h2>From Vision to Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the research in place, the real design work began. The platform's constraints—limited input 
                        types and minimal graphics—meant we had to be strategic. Questions needed to be simple yet 
                        effective, visually engaging without overwhelming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One example was a map-based direction question. The first iteration was ambitious, but we quickly 
                        realized it needed to be scaled back to fit the platform's capabilities. The second iteration 
                        balanced creativity with practicality, and the result was a seamless interaction that aligned 
                        with our goals.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Shared Effort, A Shared Success</h2>
                    <p>
                        Designing the coding product was as much about collaboration as it was about creativity. From 
                        process diagrams that outlined every stage to countless feedback sessions, it was a team effort 
                        at every step. My role extended beyond design—I created illustrations, co-wrote questions, and 
                        worked closely with the curriculum expert to ensure every piece fit into the bigger picture.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul class="lined-list">
                        <li>Educational design requires deep empathy for both teachers and students</li>
                        <li>Platform constraints can drive creative solutions</li>
                        <li>Cross-functional collaboration is essential for complex educational products</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Launch and Beyond</h2>
                    <p>
                        In January 2019, we launched the first version of Mangahigh's coding product at the BETT 
                        education conference. While this version wasn't a fully realized educational product, it was 
                        a vital first step. It demonstrated what was possible and laid the groundwork for future iterations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The journey didn't end with the launch. The lessons learned during this project continue to 
                        shape how we approach education at Mangahigh. As coding becomes an increasingly vital skill, 
                        we're proud to have taken an early step in making it accessible to learners everywhere.
