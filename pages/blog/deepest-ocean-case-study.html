                    <p>
                        The challenge was clear: create a math game that not only taught children about greater than and less than 
                        but also captivated their imaginations. I wanted to build something more than just flashcards – I wanted 
                        to create an underwater adventure that would make learning fun.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The inspiration struck when I was playing Agar.io, a popular game where players control a growing blob. 
                        Could this core mechanic – growth and competition – be adapted to teach math? The idea began to take shape.
                    </p>

                         alt="Early concept sketches" 
                         class="img-responsive"
                         loading="lazy">

                    <p>
                        I started with paper prototypes, sketching out simple games on paper and testing them with friends. 
                        These early iterations helped me refine the core mechanic, ensuring it was both engaging and aligned 
                        with the educational objectives.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, I transitioned to a digital prototype, built using JavaScript. This allowed for more dynamic 
                        testing and iteration, enabling me to quickly experiment with different gameplay elements and gather 
                        feedback from colleagues.
                    </p>

                         class="img-responsive"
                         loading="lazy">

                    <p>
                        With the core gameplay established, it was time to bring the underwater world to life. I collaborated 
                        closely with an artist, exploring various art styles and themes. We ultimately settled on a vibrant 
                        and colorful underwater environment, teeming with life and inviting exploration.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Developing the math curriculum was a collaborative effort with a math specialist. We worked together 
                        to create a series of challenging yet accessible levels, incorporating adaptive difficulty to ensure 
                        the game remained engaging for players of all skill levels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout the development process, I conducted rigorous playtesting with children aged 7-11. Observing 
                        their interactions with the game provided invaluable insights. I watched as they navigated the challenges, 
                        celebrated their successes, and even offered their own creative suggestions. This feedback was crucial in 
                        refining the game's difficulty, improving the user interface, and ensuring a truly enjoyable and rewarding 
                        experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, after months of hard work and dedication, Deepest Ocean was ready to launch. The game was 
                        well-received, providing a valuable learning resource for children worldwide. It was a rewarding experience 
                        to see how children interacted with the game and how it helped them develop a deeper understanding of 
                        mathematical concepts.

                        This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design, iterative development, and the power of 
                        collaboration. It also highlighted the potential of games to make learning engaging and enjoyable for 
                        children of all ages.
