                    <p>
                        When Mangahigh set out to improve its teacher onboarding experience, the design team wanted to 
                        ensure their efforts hit the mark. Usability testing was the answer, helping validate the designs 
                        before they reached production. This process provided valuable insights into how teachers 
                        interacted with the platform, ultimately guiding improvements to enhance the overall user experience.

                    <h2>The Challenge: Validating New Onboarding Features</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Mangahigh team had been working on three key features to enhance the teacher onboarding 
                        process: a welcome modal to introduce users to the platform, tooltips to guide them through 
                        administrative tasks, and a "What's New" section to keep them updated on platform changes. 
                        Before releasing these features, it was crucial to ensure they were intuitive and effective. 
                        As a UX researcher, my role was to organize and execute a usability test to gather actionable 
                        insights for the design team.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../images/usability-testing-process.png" 
                             alt="Flow diagram of the user testing process" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        We approached this project with a clear structure and collaborative spirit. Working with two UX 
                        designers and a project manager, we mapped out a plan to test the new features. The testing 
                        process relied on Maze for conducting unmoderated remote testing, Figma for creating prototypes, 
                        and Google Slides for presenting our findings to stakeholders. The entire effort spanned a week, 
                        with two days dedicated to planning, one day for testing, and two days for reviewing and analyzing 
                        the results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The study focused on three primary objectives: determining whether users could remember key steps 
                        from the welcome modal, identifying how effectively they could locate and use the tooltips, and 
                        assessing their ability to navigate to the "What's New" section. By creating targeted tasks for 
                        these features, we aimed to uncover usability issues and areas for improvement.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What We Discovered</h2>
                    <p>
                        The results of the usability test were revealing. For the welcome modal, only two out of five 
                        participants successfully remembered the steps it outlined. Several users skipped the modal 
                        entirely, eager to jump straight into the platform. This highlighted the need to present 
                        information more prominently and make it instantly memorable.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/usability-testing-results.png" 
                             alt="Testing results and heatmaps" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The tooltips posed an even greater challenge. Only one participant successfully located and used 
                        them. The rest became lost, overwhelmed by the competing features on the admin page. This pointed 
                        to a need for simplifying the page layout and improving the visibility of tooltips to ensure they 
                        stood out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The "What's New" section fared slightly better, with three participants navigating to it within 
                        20 seconds. However, the intercom help button proved to be a significant distraction, drawing 
                        attention away from the section. Reducing the size of the intercom button emerged as a simple 
                        yet effective solution to guide users more effectively.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Acting on Feedback</h2>
                    <p>
                        The findings from this test were instrumental in shaping the next steps for the project. We 
                        recommended refining the designs to address the issues uncovered during testing. This included 
                        reworking the welcome modal to ensure the information was clear and memorable, simplifying the 
                        layout of the admin page to make tooltips easier to find, and adjusting the placement and size 
                        of the intercom button to reduce distractions.
                    </p>

                             loading="lazy">
                    </div>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focused testing yields precise, actionable insights</li>
                        <li>Unmoderated testing provides quick feedback but has limitations</li>
                        <li>Visual hierarchy significantly impacts feature discoverability</li>
                        <li>User behavior often differs from design assumptions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project underscored the importance of focused testing. By asking specific questions and 
                        using targeted prototypes, we were able to gather precise data that directly informed design 
                        decisions. At the same time, it highlighted the limitations of unmoderated testing. While this 
                        method provided quick insights, it lacked the ability to explore users' thought processes in 
                        depth. Despite this, the data collected during this study established a valuable benchmark for 
                        evaluating future design iterations.
