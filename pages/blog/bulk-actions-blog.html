                    <p>
                        When it comes to designing in the health tech space, each decision has the potential to improve 
                        efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline care. Recently, I had the opportunity to work on 
                        expanding the functionality of a feature in an electronic patient record (EPR) system developed 
                        by Mayden. This project, undertaken in September 2023, was both challenging and rewarding, 
                        requiring a blend of research, collaboration, and iteration.
                    </p>

                             alt="Overview of the bulk actions workflow" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
                    <p>
                        The system already offered a robust tool for users to send patient information to other online 
                        services. However, this functionality was limited to handling one patient at a time. As needs 
                        evolved, so did the demand: users needed a way to process multiple patients simultaneously. The 
                        solution? Leverage the existing bulk actions feature while maintaining familiarity and ease of use.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To tackle this, I worked as part of an agile team comprising six developers, a project owner, 
                        and a scrum master, contributing as the UX designer and researcher. Over eight weeks, we explored, 
                        designed, tested, and iterated on the feature to deliver a seamless solution.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        To kick things off, I documented the current workflows for both single and bulk actions. Using 
                        demo instances and tapping into the expertise of my colleagues, I mapped out the intricacies of 
                        how these features functioned and identified the users who relied on them most.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../images/bulk-actions-research.png" 
                             alt="Workflow mapping and user research documentation" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <p>
                        Key insight: While the single-action flow was straightforward, integrating it into the bulk 
                        actions flow introduced complexities that needed careful consideration.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Designing the Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        The design process began with creating a prototype that expanded bulk actions to support multiple 
                        referrals. This prototype retained familiar elements from the existing workflows, ensuring users 
                        felt confident navigating the updated process.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <div class="img-container content-image">
                        <img src="../../images/bulk-actions-prototype.png" 
                             alt="Figma prototypes and design iterations" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <p>
                        Tools used:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Miro for collaboration</li>
                        <li>Figma for high-fidelity prototypes</li>
                        <li>Maze for usability testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Testing and Iterating</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the prototype in hand, I conducted usability tests to validate the design. The first round, 
                        conducted on high-fidelity wireframes, provided invaluable insights.
                    </p>

                             alt="Usability testing heatmaps and feedback" 
                             class="img-responsive"
                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <ul>
                        <li>Heatmaps showed where users clicked and highlighted areas of confusion.</li>
                        <li>Feedback: Users found the feature name unclear, prompting collaboration with the product team to refine terminology.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Development Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        As development progressed, legacy code presented unexpected technical limitations. One critical 
                        issue emerged: the additional fields for selecting online providers couldn't dynamically load 
                        without refreshing the page.
                    </p>

                             loading="lazy">
                    </div> -->

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rapid prototyping fostered collaboration, ensuring the entire team shared a unified vision</li>
                        <li>Agile iteration allowed us to quickly adapt to technical constraints without sacrificing user experience</li>
                        <li>User testing early and often helped identify and address issues before they became problems</li>
                        <li>Sometimes, practical compromises are necessary to deliver value while maintaining quality</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        As the feature undergoes a pilot study, there are exciting opportunities for iteration. 
                        Addressing accessibility and heuristic issues within the broader bulk actions framework will 
                        be a priority for future improvements.
                    </p>
